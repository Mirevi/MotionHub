CMake MMH manual:


1.  Download or clone MMH
2.  Download CMake GUI and start it
3.  In CMake, set source to the MMH path
4.  Set binaries to (MMH path)/build
5.  Click configure. This will take a few minutes so go on with 6 and 7.

6.  Download Azure Kinect Sensor		   SDK (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/sensor-sdk-download)
7.  Download Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/body-sdk-download)
8.  Meanwhile, the configuration process in CMake should have failed. 
9.  Copy the installed Azure Kinect Folders to MMH/deps. You can delete the "tools"-Folder in both, they are very big

10. In CMake, set the flags "advanced" and "grouped", you should see all dependencies listed
11. Under K4A set the paths to the include (something like this: MMH/deps/Azure Kinect SDK v1.4.0/sdk/include) and lib folder (MMH/deps/Azure Kinect SDK v1.4.0/sdk/windows-desktop/amd64/release/lib)
12. Repeat for K4ABT (MMH/deps/AzureKinectBodyTrackingSDKv1.0.1/sdk/include) and (MMH/deps/AzureKinectBodyTrackingSDKv1.0.1/sdk/windows-desktop/amd64/release/lib)
13. Again, click "Configure" (This should be successful), then click "Generate".

14. You can now click "Open Project" or open the Solution with visual Studio (MMH/build/MireviMotionHub.sln)
15. In the VS Solution Explorer, right click on the project "MireviMotionHub"->"Set as Startup Project" and "MireviMotionHub"->"build"
16. After the code is compiled, you can push F5 in VS or start MMH/build/bin/MireviMotionHub.exe to start the MotionHub
