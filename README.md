Mirevi MotionHub (MMH) is a middleware for merging body tracking data from different systems into one coordinate space in real-time in order to combine and use their individual benefits.

MMH offers support for several body tracking systems and encompasses a game engine plug-in that connects the MMH with Unity by means of a standardized protocol. The plug-in allows for the usage of a single type of skeleton for any body tracking system and, therefore, facilitates the switch between different body tracking systems during app development significantly.

MotionHub is developed at the research lab [MIREVI](https://www.mirevi.de/) from the [University of Applied Sciences DÃ¼sseldorf](https://hs-duesseldorf.de/en) within the scope of the project [HIVE](https://tinyurl.com/y3ugxo3p).
