[MIREVI](https://www.mirevi.de/) MotionHub (MMH) is a middleware for merging body tracking data from different systems into one coordinate space in real-time in order to combine and use their individual benefits.

MMH offers support for several body tracking systems and encompasses a game engine plug-in that connects the MMH with Unity by means of a standardized protocol. The plug-in allows for the usage of a single type of skeleton for any body tracking system and, therefore, facilitates the switch between different body tracking systems during app development significantly.

MotionHub is developed at the research lab [MIREVI](https://www.mirevi.de/) from the [University of Applied Sciences DÃ¼sseldorf](https://hs-duesseldorf.de/en) within the scope of the project [HIVE](https://mirevi.de/research/immersive-digital-technologies-for-a-healthy-life-through-exercise-and-well-being-hive-lab).

# Setup and Building

The [CMake](https://cmake.org/) system is used to generate project files and for downloading all required dependencies. Please use the `CMakeLists.txt` file for generating.

- MMH is developed with Microsoft **Visual Studio 2017**. *([CMake](https://cmake.org/) has only been tested with this IDE version.)*

Please Note that we use Qt Framework for the UI. To build the project you need the [Qt Visual Studio Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools-19123) and for editing Qt `.ui` files you need [Qt Designer](https://www.qt.io/download).
